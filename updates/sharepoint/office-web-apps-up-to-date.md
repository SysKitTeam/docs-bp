# Office Web Apps Up to Date

## Issue description

This check determines whether all Office Web Apps servers are up to date.

## Explanation

Microsoft releases Office Web Apps updates to ensure that the bugs found in the product are fixed. In addition, new functionality may be introduced with updates. Therefore, it is important to patch Office Web Apps on regular occasions.

Although they are two separate products, make sure that SharePoint and Office Web Apps servers are running on the similar patch level to ensure maximal compatibility.
