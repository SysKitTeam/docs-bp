# Search Topology Limits

## Issue description

This series of Best Practices shows whether the search topology component count is within the official Microsoft guidelines.

## Explanation

Exceeding these limits slows down the communication between search components, which can result in longer query latencies and the search not functioning properly.

| SPDocKit Best Practice | Maximum Supported Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Analytics Processing Components per Search Service Application | 6 |  |
| Analytics Processing Components per Server | 1 |  |
| Analytics Reporting Databases | 4 per Search service application | This limit is a threshold and can be exceeded to accommodate specific requirements. Create a new database when the size of any of the existing analytics report databases reaches 250 GB or 20 million rows in total. |
| Content Processing Components | 1 per server | Although a specific physical host or virtual machine does support multiple content processing components, you achieve better usage of the CPU capacity by using one content processing component. |
| Crawl Components per Search Service Application | 16 |  |
| Crawl Components per Server | 1 |  |
| Index Components per Search Service Application | 60 | The number of index components is equal to the number of index partitions multiplied by the number of index replicas. |
| Index Components per Server | 4 | The number of index components is equal to the number of index partitions multiplied by the number of index replicas. |
| Index Partitions | 25 per Search service application | An index partition is a subset of the search index. Increasing the number of index partitions results in each partition holding a smaller subset of the index, reducing the RAM and disk space that is needed on the servers hosting the index components. |
| Index Replicas | 3 per index partition | Each index partition can have a set of replicas. Replicas have a positive effect on query performance and it provides better fault tolerance. However, too many replicas per partition can affect indexing performance. |
| Link Databases | 4 per Search service application | The highest tested number of items a link database can contain is 100 million. |
| Query Processing Components | 1 per server |  |
| Search Components | 64 per Search service application | This limit does not include crawl components. The sum of all the other search components must stay within this limit. |

## Solution

Make sure that the number of components in your search topology is within the supported boundaries. To check your search topology, go to **Central Administration** &gt; **Application Management** &gt; **Manage service applications** &gt; **Search Service Application**.
