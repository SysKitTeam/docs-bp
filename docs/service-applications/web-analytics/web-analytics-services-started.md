# Web Analytics Services Started

## Issue description

This check determines whether the Web Analytics Service Application is created and started in the farm.

## Explanation

Web Analytics Service Application instances should be configured and running. A properly configured Web Analytics Service Application allows you to collect, report, and analyze the usage and effectiveness of your SharePoint sites. By using these features, you can understand what users are doing and what information they want from a site.

Please note that the Analytics components moved from the standalone web application to the Search Service Application in SharePoint 2013.
