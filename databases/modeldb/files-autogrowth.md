# ModelDB Files Autogrowth

## Issue description

This check determines whether the **model** database is set up correctly.

## Explanation

SharePoint Server uses SQL Server to store configuration and user data. Therefore it is extremely important that SQL Server be as optimized as possible. The **model** database can be set up so as to reduce administrative overhead significantly.

The **model** database is used as the template for all databases created on an instance of SQL Server. The entire contents of the **model** database, including database options, are copied to the new database. Changing the settings on the **model** database will affect all databases created afterwards.

## Solution

This is general guidance on setting the **model** database autogrowth settings. The **model** database autogrowth should be in megabytes, and set to a value larger than the default. You should not use the default settings. These values should be set in accordance with your environment. Consider, for example, a scenario where content is gradually increased, say at 100MB increments, and autogrowth is set at 10MB. Then suddenly a new document management site requires a very large amount of data storage, perhaps with initial size of 50 GB. For this large addition, growth at 500 MB increments is more appropriate than 10MB increments.
