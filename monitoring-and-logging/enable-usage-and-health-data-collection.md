# Enable Usage and Health Data Collection

## Issue description

This check determines whether the SharePoint Usage and Health Log data collection is enabled. This can provide an insight into the functioning of the system itself; however, it can also introduce additional load to the system and fill the hard drive on which the log files are stored.

## Explanation

SharePoint writes usage and health data to the logging folder and logging database. Usage and Health logs can be used to trace various events, like File I/O, SQL I/O usage, Page Requests, SQL Latency usage and many more. Default location of the logging folder is C:/Program Files/Common Files/Microsoft Shared/Web Server Extensions//LOGS. Depending on the number of users accessing the system and the logging events configured, writing to a log can have a massive impact on the file systemâ€™s performance.

## Solution

Make sure that only required events are selected for the data collection. To do so, go to the **Central Administration** &gt; **Monitoring** &gt; **Reporting** &gt; **Configure usage and health data collection**. You can use this page to configure logging level and log settings. In the case you want to turn off the Usage and **Health data collection**, under Health Data Collection clear the check box near **Enable Health Data Collection** and click **OK**.
