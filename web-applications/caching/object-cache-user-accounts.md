# Object Cache User Accounts

## Issue description

Some users, including site collection administrators, may encounter poor performance or Access Denied errors by calling the pages that are a part of the site, for example with SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure enabled, using metadata navigation, or with the Content Query Web Part. Additionally, the Application Log may contain the following errors:

> _Object Cache: The super user account utilized by the cache is not configured. This can increase the number of cache misses, which causes the page requests to consume unnecessary system resources. To configure the account use the following command ‘stsadm -o setproperty -propertyname portalsuperuseraccount -propertyvalue account -url webappurl’. The account should be any account that has Full Control access to the SharePoint databases but is not an application pool account._
>
> _Additional Data:_
>
> _Current default super user account: SHAREPOINT\system_
>
> _Object Cache: The super reader account utilized by the cache does not have sufficient permissions to SharePoint databases. To configure the account use the following command ‘stsadm -o setproperty -propertyname portalsuperreaderaccount -propertyvalue account -url webappurl’. It should be configured to be an account that has Read access to the SharePoint databases._

> _Additional Data:_

> _Current default super reader account: NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE_

## Explanation

To reduce the workload on the SQL server and improve overall performance, some SharePoint features use the object cache. Object cache requires two accounts to function properly: the Portal Super User Account and Portal Super Reader Account. By default, for SharePoint 2010 and 2013, System Account is set as a default Portal Super User Account and NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE is set as a default Portal Super Reader Account. There are two main issues with using the out-of-box accounts.

1. The first issue is that some items are checked out to System Account, so when a query that includes these items is made, the checked-out version of the item is returned instead of the latest published version. This is a problem because it is not what a user would expect to receive, so the cache has to make a second query to fetch the correct version of the file. This negatively affects server performance for every request that includes these items. The same problem would occur for any user who has items checked out if the user’s account is set as the Portal Super User Account. This is why the accounts configured to be the Portal Super User and the Portal Super Reader should not be user accounts that are used to log into the site. This ensures that the user does not inadvertently check items out and cause problems with performance.
2. The default Portal Super Reader account is NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE, which is not correctly resolved in a claims authentication application. As a result, if the Portal Super Reader Account is not explicitly configured for a claims authentication application, browsing to site collections under this application will result in an Access Denied error, even for the site administrator. This error will occur on any site that uses any feature that explicitly uses the object cache, such as the SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure, metadata navigation, the Content Query Web Part, or navigation.

## Solution

To solve the issue, you have to first add the user accounts to the Central Administration website, and then add the user accounts to the web applications using Windows PowerShell. Portal Super Reader and Portal Super User Accounts must be set once per web application.

### Create the user accounts by using Central Administration

1. Verify that the user account that is performing this procedure is a member of the Farm Administrators group on the computer that is running the SharePoint Central Administration website.
2. On the Central Administration website, in the **Application Management** section, click **Manage Web applications**.
3. Click the name of the web application that you want to configure.
4. On the **Web Applications** tab, in the **Policy** group, click **User Policy**.
5. In the Policy for Web Application window, click **Add Users**.
6. From the Zones list, select **All zones**, and then click Next.
7. In the **Users** box, type the user name for the Portal Super User account.
8. Click the **Check Names** icon to ensure that the account name can be resolved by the authentication providers on the application server.
9. In the **Choose Permissions** section, check the **Full Control – Has full control box.**
10. Click Finish.
11. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 for the Portal Super Reader account.
12. In the **Choose Permissions** section, check the **Full Read – Has full read-only access** box.
13. Click Finish.
14. Make note of how the names for the Object Cache Super Reader and Object Cache Super User accounts are displayed in the **User Name** column. The displayed strings will be different depending on whether you are using claims authentication for the web application.

### Add the user accounts to the web application by using Windows PowerShell

```bash
$wa = Get-SPWebApplication -Identity "<WebApplication>"
$wa.Properties["portalsuperuseraccount"] = "<SuperUser>"
$wa.Properties["portalsuperreaderaccount"] = "<SuperReader>"
$wa.Update()
```

Replace "WebApplication", "SuperUser" and "SuperReader" with the values appropriate for your environment. Please consider following:

* Portal Super User and Portal Super Reader Accounts must be simple domain accounts which will never be used to log on to the site.
* If the web application is in the claims mode, "SuperUser" and "SuperReader" values must be in the claims format \(e.g. i:0\#.w\|domainuser\).
