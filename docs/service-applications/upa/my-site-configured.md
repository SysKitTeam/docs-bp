# My Site Configured

## Issue description

This check determines whether the My Site URL is configured in the User Profile Service Application.

## Explanation

In SharePoint Server 2010/2013, a My Site is a personal site for individual users in an organization. By default, it provides access to the Newsfeed, OneDrive/personal site collection, personal blog, About me page, etc. My Sites give users rich social networking and collaboration features, that enable users to explore and share interests, projects, business relationships, content, and other data with people in the organization.

To benefit from the My Site functionality, a site collection must be created with the My Site Host template, and an absolute URL must be specified in the User Profile Service Application.

Check if the URL is present in the configuration by clicking on the **User Profile Service Application** and clicking on **Manage** button in the ribbon. On the **Manage Profile Service** page, in the **My Site Settings** section, click **Setup My Sites**.
