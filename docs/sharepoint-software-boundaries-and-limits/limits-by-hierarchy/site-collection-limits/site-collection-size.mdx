# Site Collection Size

## Issue description

This check determines whether site collections are growing beyond the recommended boundaries.

## Explanation

contains one top site, document libraries, lists, and other items stored within SharePoint. It can contain one or more subsites. A site collection is stored within one content database, and it cannot be split over multiple content databases. It is an isolated unit containing its own structure and permission matrix.

A site collection can be as large as the content database size limit for the applicable usage scenario:

* General usage – 200 GB
* All usage scenarios (appropriate I/O subsystem design) – 4 TB
* Document archive – no limits

However, we strongly recommend limiting the size of the site collections to 100 GB for the following reasons:

* Certain site collection actions, such as site collection backup/restore or the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Move-SPSite, cause large SQL Server operations that can affect performance or fail if other site collections are active in the same database.
* SharePoint site collection backup and restore is only supported for a maximum site collection size of 100 GB. For larger site collections, the complete content database must be backed up. If multiple site collections larger than 100 GB are contained in a single content database, backup and restore operations can take a long time and are at risk of failure.

## Solution

Please check the size of the site collections in the content database. If you have a site collection larger than 100 GB, consider creating new content databases and moving all other site collections to the new content databases.

To create a new content database, start **SharePoint 2013 Management Shell** and run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
New-SPContentDatabase "<database name>" -DatabaseServer "<database server / alias>" -WebApplication http://sitename
```

To move a site collection to the new content database, start SharePoint 2013 Management Shell as an Administrator and run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Move-SPSite http://webapp/sites/sitename -DestinationDatabase ContentDb2
```

To achieve the same result in Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and SharePoint Server 2007, follow the procedure described in the following articles:

* [Addcontentdb: Stsadm operation (Office SharePoint Server)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263422\(v=office.12\).aspx)
* [Move site collections to a new database (split a content database) (Windows SharePoint Services 3.0)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc825327\(v=office.12\).aspx)

This script extracts the web application and site collection metrics. It also checks if the site collection is within 100GB boundaries and contains less than 250.000 site collections. It extracts the following information:

* web application name, URL, site collections count and a list of site collections
* site collection URL, site count, database name and storage used.
