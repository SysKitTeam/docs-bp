# Apps Configured

## Issue description

This check determines whether the SharePoint farm is configured to support SharePoint apps.

## Explanation

To address issues caused by old full-trust and sandboxed solution models, Microsoft introduced a SharePoint app model with version 2013. In SharePoint apps, custom code doesnâ€™t have to be executed on the SharePoint server itself. Some of the benefits brought by the app model are:

* Upgrade to the newer version of the product is much easier.
* Security and stability improvements. Custom code is not running on the SharePoint server.
* Easier discovery and deployment.
* Centralized distribution and licensing via SharePoint Store.

However, the SharePoint environment and the infrastructure must be configured for SharePoint apps to work.

## Solution

SharePoint apps require following components to be configured:

* Buying a domain from the domain provider. You need to buy a public domain from the domain provider if you intend to publish your SharePoint environments and make them accessible on the Internet.
* Configure DNS records. SharePoint apps require a wildcard domain name \(CNAME record\).
* Issue a wildcard SSL certificate.
* Configure the Subscription Settings service application.
* Configure the App Management service application.
* Configure the App URLs.

The exact configuration procedure can be found under links in the **Additional information** section.
