# SharePoint IIS Log Path

## Issue description

This check determines whether the IIS Log files are stored on the primary drive.

## Explanation

The log files generated by IIS can consume a lot of space and could potentially fill an entire hard drive. This can cause many problems if logs are being stored on the primary drive, which is usually the C: drive. The default path is _%SystemDrive%inetpublogsLogFiles_.

## Solution

A couple of solutions for this problem are outlined in the following [article](http://www.iis.net/learn/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/managing-iis-log-file-storage). Whenever possible, we recommend moving the log folder to a secondary drive or a network share. The default log folder can be changed at **IIS Manager** &gt; **Connection Pane** &gt; **Logging**.

If you have multiple web front-end servers in your SharePoint farm, donâ€™t forget to update them all.
