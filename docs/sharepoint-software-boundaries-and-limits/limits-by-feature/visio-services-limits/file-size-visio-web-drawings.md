# File Size of Visio Web Drawings â€“ Max Web Drawing Size

## Issue description

This check determines whether the maximum file size of Visio Web Drawings exceeds the recommended limit.

## Explanation

The Visio Graphics Service has a Maximum Web Drawing Size setting that will adversely affect performance. If the Maximum Web Drawing Size setting is larger than 25 MB, it might result in increased bandwidth usage, decreasing the expected performance of the Visio Graphics Service.

A web drawing size increases performance by downloading smaller images, which minimizes bandwidth usage.
