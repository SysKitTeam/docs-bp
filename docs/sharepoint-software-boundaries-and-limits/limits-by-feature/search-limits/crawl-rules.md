# Crawl Rules

## Issue description

This check determines whether the SharePoint 2010 Search Service application has been properly configured.

## Explanation

The recommended limit is 100 crawl rules per application. Although this limit can be exceeded, the display of rules in Central Administration could be seriously degraded.

Make sure you do not go over the limit; if you do, reduce the number of rules to remain compliant.
