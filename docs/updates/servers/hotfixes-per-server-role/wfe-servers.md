# WFE Servers Hotfixes

## Issue description

This check determines whether all WFE servers in the environment are running on the same patch level as the rest of the environment.

## Explanation

A SharePoint farm can be scaled to contain one or more SharePoint servers, hosting one or more SharePoint components per server. This model provides scalability and it can also provide high availability. Environments supporting a high number of users and hosting a large amount of content are usually scaled in such a way that various SharePoint components have dedicated hardware or a set of resources allocated to them.

All components in a SharePoint environment should have the same patch level to provide maximum compatibility, stability and supportability. This also applies to the SharePoint WFE servers.

## Solution

You should check all the SharePoint WFE servers in your environment. Make sure that all of them have the same SharePoint patch level and Windows patch level.

To see the installed Windows and SharePoint Server updates, start **Control Panel**, go to **Programs** &gt; **Programs and Features** and click **View installed updates**. Control Panel, however, will only show installed binaries. Installing SharePoint binaries is only a part of the patching process. To verify the upgrade status of a SharePoint farm and servers in the farm, open the **Central Administration** tool, and in the **Upgrade and Migration** section, click **Check upgrade status** \(SharePoint 2010 and 2013\).
